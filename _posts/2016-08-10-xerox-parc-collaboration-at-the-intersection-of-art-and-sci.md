  By Linda Naiman One of the most enjoyable aspects of being co-author of
  Orchestrating Collaboration at Work, was interviewing some of the leading
  researchers and pioneers in the world of art in business. My phone interview
  with John Seely Brown, former chief scientist at Xerox, was a breathless
  rapid-fire stream of consciousness exchange that at times seemed like an
  un-punctuated beat poem.
